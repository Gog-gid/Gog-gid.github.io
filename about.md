Application for acceptance into tech expert academy

##

My name is Godson Onyedika Gideon, a native of Nwangele local government in Imo state, Nigeria. my purpose for creating or attempting to create this site is to apply for the training courses at tech expert academy as i would love to develope a suitable and useful skill that would enable me to get a good job and serve, learn and share my ideas. i have general knowledge of the computer and its purpose in simplifying tasks in our day to day living.

Watching the world today and the system of things, it is only fitting that i learn a skill  having no university degree; and i see this skill as the suiting one for me as i can apply the knowledge i acquire by getting a job and working with a team or i can be self employed and work on my own self inspired project.

learning this skill will also serve as a means to feed and have a useful life, to be part of a team and give myself a good life.

I hope my application suits your requirements and i will be considered for acceptance.
